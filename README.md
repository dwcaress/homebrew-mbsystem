## Homebrew tap for MB-System

MB-System is an open source software package for the processing and display of bathymetry and backscatter imagery data derived from multibeam, interferometry, and sidescan sonars. This software is documented and distributed at:

http://www.mbari.org/products/research-software/mb-system/

The MB-System project is maintaining this separate homebrew tap because this package is frequently updated and has a dependency, OTPS (tidal prediction software), that is not available through the core homebrew repositories. 

There are two MB-System packages available: mbsystem and mbsystem-beta. The first (mbsystem) installs the most recent major (stable) release from the Github repository. The second (mbsystem-beta) installs the most recent release whether it is major (stable) or beta (unstable). The MB-System development team uses beta releases for testing of new features and bug fixes. We do not recommend installing mbsystem-beta releases unless you are involved in the testing or the release includes bug fixes or new features that are directly relevant to you.

## Install:

To install the mbsystem package with full tide modeling:

`brew update`

`brew tap dwcaress/mbsystem`

`brew install otps

`brew install mbsystem`

To install the mbsystem-beta package with full tide modeling:

`brew update`

`brew tap dwcaress/mbsystem`

`brew install otps

`brew install mbsystem-beta`

To switch between mbsystem and mbsystem-beta installations, first uninstall the current package before installing the one you want, e.g.:

`brew uninstall mbsystem`

`brew install mbsystem-beta`

or:

`brew uninstall mbsystem-beta`

`brew install mbsystem`

## OTPS Tide Models
The dwcaress/otps formula will build the OTPS2 software in the directory /usr/local/Cellar/otps/2/
and make a link named /usr/local/opt/otps to this directory. In the past, the TPXO8_atlas_v1
tidal model was also installed in this location. However, the OSU tide group no longer makes 
their TPXO tidal models openly available for download. Consequently, this formula now installs 
the OTPS2 software required for the MB-System program mbotps to work, but not the associated 
tidal model. 
Academic users can register and request access to the TPXO8-atlas or TPXO9-atlas models
used by mbotps at this website:

  `https://www.tpxo.net`
  
If, for instance, you obtain the TPXO8_atlas_v1 model, it will come in the form of three files:

  `hf.tpxo8_atlas_30_v1`
  `uv.tpxo8_atlas_30_v1`
  `grid_tpxo8_atlas_30_v1`
  
Place those three files into a directory /usr/local/Cellar/otps/2/DATA/ and create in that
directory a file named Model_atlas_v1 with three lines:

  `/usr/local/Cellar/otps/2/DATA/hf.tpxo8_atlas_30_v1`
  `/usr/local/Cellar/otps/2/DATA/uv.tpxo8_atlas_30_v1`
  `/usr/local/Cellar/otps/2/DATA/grid_tpxo8_atlas_30_v1`
  
If you obtain the newer TPXO9_atlas model, put the files in the same place and make an
appropriately named model file specifying the full path to each model file.

## GMT compatibility:

MB-System depends on the GMT package at https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt, which is being actively developed and updated. Although the GMT team keeps the MB-System team apprised of upcoming changes, it has happened that a GMT release broke elements of the then-current MB-System release. In the event that a new GMT release is not backwards compatible with the current mbsystem-gmt-modules, one can prevent homebrew from updating gmt within the 'brew upgradeâ€˜ command by pinning it.

`brew pin gmt`

Once the incompatibility is resolved with a new MB-System release, gmt can then be upgraded by unpinning and upgrading it.

`brew unpin gmt`

`brew upgrade gmt`
